    // Notice the "hopefully" in the comment for the last ShootNote command? This is one of the issues with time-based autos.
    // First of all, time-based autos can be inaccurate, as your batteries won't always have the same voltage and sometimes you may have wheel slip, etc.
    // This is solved using PID to make sure your motors get to a set position/velocity, or Pathplanning, which utilizes PID with a generated path to follow as accurately as possible.

    // Second of all, this time-based auto doesn't ensure that we get to the right position, or that our flywheels are up to speed, or that we actually intake a note in the first place!
    // This means that the auto has the potential to miss sometimes.
    // But, this also means that the auto is SLOW. By utilizing commands that automatically shoot once our flywheels are up to speed, or utilizing intake commands that end once
    // a game piece has been grabbed, we can make the commands only run as long as they have to, and make the auto much faster
